After exeuction of Playfaire and Row Transposition cipher, please remove the
following two files, ".playfair_padding_location" and
".rowtransposition_fillers".

Here is a list of requirements for our key choices of each cipher.
For Caesar cipher, a candidate key is a non-negative integer.
For Vigenere cipher, a candidate key is a string of English alphabet.
For Railfence cipher, a candidate key is a positive integer.
For Row Transposition cipher, a candidate key is a string of English alphabet
with its length less than the number of characters in the text.
For Playfair cipher, a candidate key is a string of English alphabet.

We have not implemented the Hi/ell Cipher.
